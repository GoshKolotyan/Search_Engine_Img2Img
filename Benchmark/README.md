## **Roadmap for Image-to-Image Search Engine Benchmark**

### **1. Summary of Key Takeaways**
- **Start with clear objectives** (understand what “similar” means for your case).
- **Select or create a robust dataset** with the right balance of diversity and specificity.
- **Thoroughly annotate** the dataset to establish a ground truth (positive vs. negative pairs, or relevant vs. non-relevant images).
- **Choose metrics** that reflect both ranking quality and user needs (mAP, P@k, nDCG).
- **Analyze results** in detail to pinpoint weaknesses and guide further system improvements.

### **2. Similarity Definition**

In our case, **similarity** primarily involves the **shapes and colors** of the item. We already know the searchable categories (e.g., sinks, tubs, cabinets). In short, we focus on **retrieval based on specific attributes** (color, texture, style).  

- **Scope:** We plan to use approximately 20K total items spanning all categories.  
- **Users:** E-commerce customers looking for items visually similar to their product images (e.g., matching a particular style of sink).

### **3. Dataset Selection**

1. **Public Benchmark Datasets**  
   - [Flickr8k / Flickr30k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hsrobo/flickr30k) (general images)  
   - [COCO (Common Objects in Context)](https://cocodataset.org/) (broader labeled images)  
   - [Oxford and Paris Datasets](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/oxbuildings/) (landmark retrieval)  
   - [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) or [DeepFashion](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html) (fashion-based similarity)  

   These can be used until we have our own **domain-specific data** (e.g., “Domus data” or “Ideal data”). We can also merge them to increase coverage of various attributes.

2. **Dataset Variety**  
   - Ensure the dataset has enough variety in terms of color, shape, texture, and context.  
   - Split the dataset into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets if you need to train/finetune any components.

3. **Dataset Structure Example**  
```

### **4. Definition of Similarity Criteria**

- **Visual Matching:** Our main objective is to compare embeddings based on item shape and color.
- **Threshold Setting:** We will test the similarity threshold between two embeddings using a chosen distance metric (e.g., **angular** or **cosine similarity**).  
- **Different Angles/Backgrounds:** Still count as relevant if the core item (shape/color) is the same.  

**Recommended Metrics:**  
- **Precision at k (P@k)**  
- **Recall at k (R@k)**  
- (Optionally) **Mean Average Precision (mAP)** and **nDCG** for more nuanced ranking analysis.

### **5. Design of Benchmark Experiments**

1. **Query Set Selection**  
   - Select representative images for querying, ensuring variety in **color**, **shape**, and **category**.  
   - Example: for a sink, pick one black circular sink, one white rectangular sink, etc.

2. **Execution of Searches**  
   - For each query image, the search engine returns a ranked list of results.  
   - Record the top-k (or full list) for evaluation.

3. **Comparison with Ground Truth**  
   - For each query, compare the retrieved results with the known set of relevant images (same category/attributes).

4. **Repetition and Stability**  
   - Repeat retrieval if there’s any randomness (e.g., data augmentation) to measure consistency.

5. **Scalability Tests**  
   - Measure how performance changes as the dataset size grows (10k, 50k, 100k images, etc.).

---

### **6. Automate the Evaluation Pipeline**

1. **Scripting**  
   - Create scripts or notebooks to:  
     1. Run queries through the search engine.  
     2. Collect the ranked results.  
     3. Compare with ground truth labels (relevant vs. non-relevant).  
     4. Compute metrics (e.g., P@k, R@k, mAP, nDCG).

2. **Reporting**  
   - Automatically generate structured output for each metric, including:  
     - Overall score (e.g., mean average precision).  
     - Per-category or per-attribute breakdown (helps diagnose strengths/weaknesses).

3. **Version Control**  
   - Keep the evaluation code in a repository (Git, etc.) for reproducibility.  
   - Tag or label each experiment setup (model version + dataset split).

---

### **7. Analyze and Interpret Results**

1. **Overall Performance**  
   - Look at the average performance (e.g., mean AP) across all queries.

2. **Identify Failure Cases**  
   - Examine queries with low performance.  
   - Determine if issues stem from poor feature extraction, incorrect ground truth, or ambiguous similarity definitions.

3. **Comparison to Other Methods**  
   - If a baseline method exists (e.g., simple color histogram), compare it to the new method (CNN-based embeddings) to gauge improvement.

4. **Statistical Significance**  
   - Use tests (t-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) to confirm differences in metrics are not due to chance.

## **Final Thoughts**
This roadmap provides a structured plan to build, evaluate, and refine an **image-to-image search engine** focused on shape and color similarity. By following these steps—selecting a balanced dataset, clearly defining similarity, automating the evaluation process, and analyzing results—you will be able to reliably measure and improve your system’s performance over time. 

Good luck with your benchmarking!
